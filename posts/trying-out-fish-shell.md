* [Where I found out about using expr from coreutils to fill in for missing string manip functionality](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/924)
* [In case you need multiline text literally in env vars](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/159)
* Confused on how to split strings into arrays? Just try this: ```count (echo 0:0:0|sed 's/:/\n/g')```
