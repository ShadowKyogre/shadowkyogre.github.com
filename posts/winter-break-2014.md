Dug up my github blog again to post some more on it. So, what was I doing?

- Watching [shadypenguinn's youtube videos](https://youtube.com/shadypenguinn) out of boredom
- Omega Ruby IV Breeding in preparation for online Pokemon battling 
- Thumbing through mikidown source code to prepare it for translation
- Getting flooded with presents (no, really)
- Randomly painting and sketching
- Switching from copy.com to SyncThing
- Watching anime (Parasyte quickly shot up to one of my top shows to continue watching)
