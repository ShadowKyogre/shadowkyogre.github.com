Here's [part 1](/posts/my-experiences-with-ninit-part-1) for those of you who missed the previous one. 

So far, I didn't have to change my setup except to enable kernel logging since I've been having some 
hibernate issues since moving my Linux desktop to another computer so I could convert my current 
desktop to a server.

That's... pretty much it asides from swapping out wicd for connman.
