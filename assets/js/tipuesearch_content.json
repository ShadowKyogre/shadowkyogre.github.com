      "text": "This post is a collection of notes of the process I went through to take out \nsystemd for ninit. Pardon for the scarcity, but I'll revisit this with better descriptions.\nWhat IS ninit?\nPreparation\n\nInstall procps-ng-nosystemd\nTemporary symlink to systemd-udevd\nInstall ninit\nSet up service directories. You can find a rough copy (though not perfectly \nsynced) copy of my /etc/ninit dir here\nReboot\n\nPost-install\neudev{,-systemdcompat}\n\nmanually build eudev and eudev-systemdcompat\nRemove the symlink from preparations in systemd\nintall eudev and eudev-systemdcompat\nReboot to test things\n\nnsvc -o {halt,reboot} vs ninit-shutdown -{o,r}\nI recommend ninit-shutdown -{o,r} if you don't want to manually handle turning \nservices off before doing shutdown preparations in the halt service. ninit-shutdown \nalso assumes quite a few things about how a system should be cleaned up, so if you \nwant more control, you're going to have to fiddle with the halt service to shutdown \nthe services you want in the correct order before halting.\nOptional: pretty messages for every section started\n[Edit]: Forgot to fill this section out. Basically, all that's needed for this is a \nsetup file that echos out a simple message.\nDepends aren't really \"depends\" - more like \"start before\"\nTitle says it all. ninit won't actually check if the services that a service depends \non have finished executing with success or are running. Just ran some tests in my \ntest box. Didn't seem to restart dbus even when I had two things dependent on it. \nHowever, statement about whether something finishes with success is still valid.\nSome ways to work around this include:\n\nSpecify the order daemons are started in like /etc/rc.conf, except with \n/etc/ninit/daemon/depends: Simple enough work around. Everything's also started \nin parallel like this.\nPatch ninit to include a separate file for services (opt) that specifies true \ndeps that're only run once OR modifies the depends of certain services once it's \ndone running: Too complex, but could be done. to do something about the return \ncode for one-run services.\nUse setup, rsetup, or sys-rsetup to do the dependency checking for shared \ndependencies: One of the things that the ninit docs don't tell you is that using \nnsvc as a synced or waited service is NOT a good idea (nor as a services that's in \ndepends either). I really wouldn't recommend this because this makes things complex. \nOnly applicable for one-run services.\n\nThoughts\nninit's good enough if you've got a static configuration that doesn't have too many depends \nthat can be easily managed and that don't require too many static initializations. It also \ndoesn't seem to keep track of exit codes for error spotting (since a service could fail, but \nreport back as finished. This is especially bad in mounting cases unless you force the mount \nto be verbose or write a wrapper to do something on that error). However, it'll happily report \nif something failed to run if it was a continuous service. There also isn't much documentation \non what the nsvc -L output indicates. I'll try to document these later.\nFor true depends for one-time initializations, I'd recommend something else (at least until I can \nfigure out how to patch the run helper in ninit to work around this). I'm thinking of maybe also \ntrying out busybox init+(monit or perp), initng, OpenRC, or initscripts-fork. Currently, I'm \ninterested in trying monit (even though this'd probably be a little too big for my own needs) since \nit does this dependency checking on its own and provides some additional security features that can \nbe coded (eg: stop running a compromised service). The only thing that scares me about it is that it \nprefers pid files instead of being a direct parent of the process (as evidenced by with matching|pidfile \nwhen asking what to check for a pid). I just need to figure out which init system to run it from before \nI start trying it out.\nResources\n\nhttp://www.linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/blfs-support/2004-March/049009.html\nhttps://github.com/ShadowKyogre/ninit-boot\nhttps://github.com/ShadowKyogre/systemd-unit-converter",
