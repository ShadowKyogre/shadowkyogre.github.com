Anyway, I started my trek into Linux quite a few years ago with Puppy Linux. After that, I started using PCLinuxOS since looked so similar to Windows XP if configured right. I started hopping between PCLinuxOS, Arch Linux, and Windows XP for a while before finally settling down with Arch.\r\n\r\n<some block about how I got into software development>\r\n\r\nSo, here I am, using Arch Linux as my primary OS on my desktop, though my laptop still dual boots with Arch Linux and Windows 7.\r\n\r\n#### Hobbies\r\n* Programming\r\n* Drawing\r\n* Writing\r\n* Roleplaying\r\n* Playing videogames\r\n* Ogling random webpages\r\n\r\n#### Contact\r\n* freenode IRC Nickname: ShadowKyogre\r\n* dA Username: ShadowKyogre\r\n* AUR/Arch Linux Forums Username: ShadowKyogre\r\n* Email: shadowkyogre@aim.com\r\n* AIM: ShadowKyogre\r\n* MSN/Yahoo: Ask\r\n* Skype: Ask\r\n\r\n#### Some random goodies\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/ShadowKyogre/dotfiles\">My underwhelming collection of dotfiles</a>\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/ShadowKyogre/random-scripts\">My collection of random scripts</a>\r\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/ShadowKyogre/Distro-Packaging\">Buildscripts for packages on various distros.
