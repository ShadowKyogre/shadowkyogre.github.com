## A little bit about myself
I'm commonly referred to as Saph or ShadowKyogre, depending on how one first comes across me. Anyway, I started my trek into Linux quite a few years ago with Puppy Linux. After that, I started using PCLinuxOS since looked so similar to Windows XP if configured right. I started hopping between PCLinuxOS, Arch Linux, and Windows XP for a while before finally settling down with Arch.

<some block about how I got into software development>

So, here I am, using Arch Linux as my primary OS on my desktop, though my laptop still dual boots with Arch Linux and Windows 7.
