ChronosLNX is somewhat of a clone of [ChronosXP](http://chronosxp.sourceforge.net/en/) for Linux systems primarily, although it will work on Windows and Macs, I think. It has most of the basic features of ChronosXP, but it might be missing some.

If you have suggestions for lightening up or tidying up the code, visit the [Issues page](https://github.com/ShadowKyogre/ChronosLNX/issues) for it and bug me about it.

## Dependencies

* PyQt
* PySwisseph
* python-dateutil

## Screenshots

All screenshots are located [here](/galleries/screenshots/ChronosLNX)

## Install

Copy the files to /usr/share/chronoslnx if you plan to use the *.desktop file included. If not, feel free to leave it where you downloaded it or place it somewhere else. You can also replace the icons for the planets and the program if you want to.

## Todo

* Find an alternate sunrise/sunset method to make this lighter
* Find an alternate moon phase method to make this lighter
* Add play a sound action to the events
